# Vehicle_Classifier_CNN

A deep learning model built using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify vehicles into four categories: bicycle, car, motorbike, and truck. It leverages transfer learning with ResNet-50, combined with data augmentation and optimization techniques, to achieve high accuracy and reliable performance.
